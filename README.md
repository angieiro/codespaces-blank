# C# Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of C# practice files and mini-projects, each demonstrating different aspects of C# programming, including collections, LINQ, and object-oriented design.

## Contents

### Phase 1

- **CollectionsPractice.cs**  
  Practice with C# collections (`List`, `Dictionary`), simple algorithms, and user input/output.  
  - Add two numbers from user input.
  - Manage a list of students and their grades.
  - Find the highest grade.
  - Query a student's grade.
  - Count digit occurrences in squares of numbers.
  - Multiply all elements in an array.

- **TopCustomersBySpend.cs**  
  Demonstrates LINQ usage to find the top 3 customers by their total order amount.  
  - Defines `Customer` and `Order` classes.
  - Uses LINQ to aggregate and sort customer spending.

- **HotelBookingSystem.cs**

  - Demonstrates inheritance and encapsulation.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed (version 8.0 or later).**
2. **Build and run the project:**
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```
   Or, to run a specific file, set its entry point as the `Main` method in your project.

3. **Edit or explore the code in Visual Studio Code for learning and experimentation.**

## Requirements

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio Code (recommended) with the C# extension
